No problem, I will contact you as soon as I know, I promise
You are welcome
Enjoy the rest of your day
Hello #NAME#, thank you for your message.
I will have a look for you.
Can I have your order number?
Could you please confirm your full name, first line of address and email address.
Thank you for confirming.
The item shows as dispatching.
I will do a warehouse query to get the exact date, they can take up to 4 working days to respond.
But as soon as they do, I will update you.
We can also then look into compensation for the delay once the item arrives to you.
I can email #PRS_ORG# once the item is on route to them to change the delivery address to that for you.
Good afternoon
Thanks for contacting #PRS_ORG#, you are through to #NAME#
So that I can assist you can you please provide your account details (Full Name, E-mail address, Postal Address and Order Number)
So the #PRS_ORG#, Esche und Grau?
Thank you.
Regrettably your order has been delayed whilst shipping to us from the manufacturer which is why your dispatch date has changed.
The expected dispatch is now showing as
26-Jan-2021.
There’s currently a lot of pressure on global shipping around the world.
As a result, our products are taking longer to arrive into ports.
This does unfortunately mean that your dispatch date may change again, or your order could be delayed further.
I understand that this will be disappointing, but please rest assured that we are doing all we can to get your order to you as quickly as possible.
If you are happy to continue with the order, we ask that you get back in touch once it has been delivered so we can review the full delay and your customer journey as a whole.
If the delay remains at over 14 days we will happily offer a good will gesture to apologise for the delay.
Of course, if you would prefer to not wait any longer, you can cancel your order for a full refund at any time before delivery
Once you have received, we can take a look at compensation for you
No.
as we look at the journey as a whole and the item could dispatch earlier, so this is done once the item is received
Please check your order for any updates and come back to us once received, so we can take a look at this for you
I'm not sure I understand what you mean.
Let me just take a look at the website
sorry...
It looks like the 160cm x200 should be available, but I'm just trying to work out why this is not showing on the website in case there is an error
This looks from the production software as though the stock is for 160x200
I will raise this issue with the mixed dimensions with the products team
If they inform me that this is in fact 180x200 then I will let you know immediately.
However, the item code should be unique to each item and the one on this page shows on the production software as a #PRS_ORG# size bed
I believe a #PRS_ORG# king size is 160x200?
And this is what you are wanting?
Yes, so I believe this is the dimension which you can see listed.
It is the #NUMBER# which is the error!
Is there anything else I can help with?
You're welcome
Enjoy the rest of your day - and your ##PRS_ORG## bed!

Thank you - one moment
Okay, so yes the slats are included with the bed, they are part of the bed
The weights are as attached
The delivery is as the email states and not to room of choice
Regrettably, this is not guaranteed - please see the delivery section for uptodate information
For houses, this means we'll place items in your driveway, rear garden (where there is a side entrance) or garage while maintaining social distancing.
If these locations aren't available, we'll place items outside your home where requested when we arrive.
For flats and apartments, we'll place items in the ground floor communal hallway or doorway.
This is because it is not possible to maintain social distancing while climbing stairwells carrying furniture.
For all deliveries, our drivers will photograph your items in situ and record this in our Place of Delivery form.
Yes, in the communal area
Good Morning

Good Morning #NAME#!
Thank you for getting in touch
How can I help you today?
We would advise that the slatted base cannot be replaced as the frame is designed to  support the slats
So I have looked at the assembly instructions for the #PRS_ORG# bed
I believe this can be adapted to support another base instead of the slats
Of course!
I would say yes, as long as the replacement legs can align with the screw holes from the original
Yes, as our beds are manufactured to order the lead times may vary depending on the colour
But 10-12 weeks is accurate
So if you place the order today there would be a 10-12 week shipping date.
Delivery would be mid April
So if you follow this link
And scroll down we have customer photos from #PRS_ORG# so you can see the bed in person
Bear with me and I will see if I have any photos available
Good Morning #NAME#
